## About

Using data collected from Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems, we aim to explore the dataset with different attributes of high performing students and poor performing students to understand the roles of these associated attributes in a student’s performance. 
To measure performance, we will consider average grades combining maths and Portuguese (native language) subjects’ grades drawn from two Portuguese schools.
