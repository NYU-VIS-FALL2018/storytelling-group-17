            <h1>What makes student performing well?</h1>
            <p>In a world of equitable education for all, it is surprising that these students have been relegated to near abandonment. While their dominant culture or high aptitude peers have been transitioned into college bound tracks and advanced courses, students have simply slipped into despair due to a quagmire of issues: learning disabilities, low-socioeconomic status, broken homes, behavioral struggles and constant moving between schools.</p>
            <p>Wondering how we could improve overall student motivation and self-concept, we came across the idea of exploring our dataset of students performance for two portuguese schools and analysing the outbound factors that contribute to their performance. </p>
            <p>While looking at the overall distribution of grades, we got the following results:</p>
            
            <div class="center_box">
                <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js"></script>
                <svg width="460" height="450" id="total_bar"> </svg>     
                <script src="bar_new.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
            </div>    
            
            <p>Of course, there are are multiple factors that would impact a students performance. However, we wanted to take into consideration some of the major factors that would be very essential for a students performance such as their background.
            </p>
            <p>Peeling the layers one by one, we first want to check if where students come from has an impact on his/her performance. The two things that come into our mind when we think about background is a personâ€™s hometown and their family background.</p>
            
            <div class="mainView">
                <div>
                    <p>While thinking about background, we went ahead and compared how
                        <span style=font-weight:bold> students performance vary when they come from an urban or a rural hometown. 
                        </span>
                    </p>

                <div id="chart-scatter">
                    <p>To dig further, we wanted to see, if having educated parents makes an impact on students performace. For that reason, we
                        comapared a students overall performance from 1 to 20 and if they had educated father and mother
